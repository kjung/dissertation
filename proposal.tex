% for a variety of reasons this is an all in one document; however,
% when actually doing the thesis it is strongly recommended that each
% chapter be in a separate file and use \include to include in the
% main file.

%% the \beforepreface command produces the title/Users/kjung/Dropbox/Nigam/NLP_Compare/Submit/JUNG_JAMIA_MANUSCRIPT_revised_clean.docx page
%% in the online version it skips the copyright (page 2) and signature (page 3) pages 
%% in the non-online version these would be included
    \beforepreface

%% Abstract can be any number of pages
    \prefacesection{Abstract}
Abstract abstract abstract

%% one can also have a prefacesection that is a Preface instead of 
%% Acknowledgements.   The thematic purpose is the same (thanks).  
    \prefacesection{Acknowledgements} 
Ack ack ack

%% afterpreface produces a table of contents and any other tables
%% wanted. At the end pagenumbering changes from roman to arabic and  
%% is restarted 
    \afterpreface 

%% Normally the \chapter and any text would be in a separate file and included.
%    \chapter{Introduction} 
\include{ch1}

\include{ch2}

\include{ch3}

\include{ch4}

\include{ch5}

%% Conclusions and Future Work
%% \include{ch6}

%% for Bibliography I would recommend a separate .bib file (bibtex) instead of inline as here.
