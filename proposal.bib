A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general gradient descent "boosting" paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion.Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire and Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani are discussed.},

   journal = {Weather and Forecasting},

   pages = {752-757},
   abstract = {Abstract The Brier score is widely used for the verification of probability forecasts. It also forms the basis of other frequently used probability scores such as the rank probability score. By conditioning (stratifying) on the issued forecast probabilities, the Brier score can be decomposed into the sum of three components: uncertainty, reliability, and resolution. This Brier score decomposition can provide useful information to the forecast provider about how the forecasts can be improved. Rather than stratify on all values of issued probability, it is common practice to calculate the Brier score components by first partitioning the issued probabilities into a small set of bins. This note shows that for such a procedure, an additional two within-bin components are needed in addition to the three traditional components of the Brier score. The two new components can be combined with the resolution component to make a generalized resolution component that is less sensitive to choice of bin width than is the traditional resolution component. The difference between the generalized resolution term and the conventional resolution term also quantifies how forecast skill is degraded when issuing categorized probabilities to users. The ideas are illustrated using an example of multimodel ensemble seasonal forecasts of equatorial sea surface temperatures.
